# 시스템 해킹 연습 코드

> K-shield Jr. 12기 취약점 분석 트랙 과정 중 시스템 해킹 연습에 사용한 코드입니다.

## ACCOUNT
This is a code for analyzing vulnerabilities in a simple user account management program. It includes features such as user registration, login, and password changes, and may contain various vulnerabilities such as insufficient input validation, buffer overflows, and format string issues. It was created for hands-on practice in system hacking and vulnerability analysis.

## HASH-MAP
This code demonstrates interaction with a binary named `hash_map`, likely from a CTF or binary exploitation challenge. It uses the `pwntools` library to automate commands to manipulate various data structures (like `hash_map`, `object`, `integer_array`, and `object_array`) through a custom interface. The script showcases how to create these structures, set and retrieve values, and inspect internal behavior—possibly for reverse engineering or vulnerability discovery. It sets up the environment using a specified version of `libc` to ensure consistent behavior during analysis.
